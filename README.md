Qtum PHP script to showcase token operations
Requires php gmp lib
qtumd should be started with -logevents (and -txindex if the node running this is not the one with the deposit addresses)
 
This script is just a showcase of how to implement QRC20 operations, it cannot be used for production
For your production environemnt, make sure you have all validations, and errors handling and security tested
